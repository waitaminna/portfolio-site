                    JavaScript to alter the page. I have an idea that this all looks like a folder and each one is a tab. 
                    maybe a bit too cute? lol. Maybe an idea for another day -->

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Minna, a Melbourne-based developer looking for my next web project.
                I love to create personalised websites with fully responsive functionality, 
                whether it's for an individual or a company.

                I have experience with HTML, CSS, Sass & SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I am 
                proficient in working with both APIs and ServiceWorker for modern applications 
                that fit the industry standard in 2020.
                
                Need a site? Send me an enquiry and I will be in contact with you shortly!
            </p>

            anything here yet so be sure to add something after you do this site babe. -->
